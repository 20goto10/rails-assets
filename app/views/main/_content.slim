          ## Bundler

          Add `http://rails-assets.org` as a&nbsp;new source, then reference any Bower components that you need as gems in the&nbsp;following&nbsp;convention:

              gem 'rails-assets-BOWER_PACKAGE_NAME'

          During `bundle` `install`, if Bundler requests a&nbsp;package like this, Rails Assets’ daemon automatically&nbsp;will:

          * fetch the component from Bower’s&nbsp;registry,
          * analyze its manifest file, `bower.json`,
          * repackage the component as a&nbsp;valid&nbsp;Ruby gem and&nbsp;serve&nbsp;it to your application.

          Dependencies are handled the&nbsp;same way&nbsp;recursively.

          ## Asset pipeline

          You can `require` any asset that’s exposed as&nbsp;`main` in&nbsp;component’s manifest file.

          Gems created by Rails Assets work great with any Sprockets-based application.

      .grid__cell.unit-1-2
        = render 'shared/diff_javascript'
        = render 'shared/diff_stylesheet'
